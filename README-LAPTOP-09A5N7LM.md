## Description

TakeOff is a travel planning and blog application. Once the user adds a destination they are able to add a travel itinarary. The itinarary allows the user to schedule events throughout their travels. This helps the user maxamize their time. Traffic and weather conditions can affect your plans, but with a travel itinarary on hand you can be more flexible.

Users can also create blogs of their favorite travel memories and list destinations for their future adventures.
